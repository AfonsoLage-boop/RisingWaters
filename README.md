## __Movie Synopsis__

A poor artist and a young rich woman meet and fall in love while in the Titanic.
 Although she is married to a soon to be successful business owner, she defies
  her family and friends in search of the one true love.  

## __What We Want Out of The Movie__

In this project we are going to focus on the second part of the movie. We are
 going to focus on the part when the ship is sinking and we'll try to capture
 that moment in our game.

## __History__

You're **Arthur**, one of the few reporters who were lucky enough to get
 selected to be able to get on board of the Titanic on its inaugural trip. You
 were tasked to write an article about what's like to be on board of the
 world's fanciest ship.  
</br>
You get to your room and start to rest when suddenly you feel the ship shaking
 and you hear the alarms. You go gather your stuff and go out of the room to
 see what's going on when out of nowhere you see water flooding the hallway
 so you start to do the only thing you can think of...you run!

## __Mechanics__

### __First Half of the game__

- __Jump__ -> [W], [Up Key] or [Space];
- __Crouch__ -> [S], [Down Key] or [Control];  
</br>
In this part of the game the player is running through the hallways in order to
 escape the water. He has to jump or crouch to avoid the obstacles he faces
 otherwise he will slow down and get consumed by the wave of water behind him.
 As the player goes up the stairs onto the next hallway the ship's leaning
 gets progressively wider.
  
### __Second Half of the game__

- __Move Left or Right__ -> [A] or [D], [Left Key] or [Right Key] ;  
- __Jump__ -> [W], [Up Key] or [Space];  
</br>
In this second half of the game the player is on top of a table that is
 floating on the water. The player has to dodge falling debris and use them to
 stay floating. Each time a debris fall on the water it only floats for a
 limited time (the starting door included). This way he will be able to stay
 a float.

## __Game Objectives__  

- __First Half__ -> Escape from the water while avoiding various obstacles;
- __Second Half__ -> Use the rising water to get to the other side of the ship
 without getting hit by de debris;

## __Game "World"__

During the **first half** of the game Arthur is running through hallways trying
 to escape the water that is flooding the ship. Then he gets hit with a table
  in the face and is knocked unconscious.  
</br>
During the **second half** he wakes up on top of a table floating on the water,
 the ship now is fully sideways and the water is quickly rising. Arthur uses
 the falling debris to stay on top of the water and to try to escape from the
 ship.

## __Game Agents__

- __Arthur__ -> He is our main character and the player controls him.
  
- __Various types of debris__ -> These are all types of objects that can fall on
 the player and slow him down. For example, chairs, lamps...etc.
  
- __Obstacles__ -> Which the player has to jump over or slide under so he
 doesn't hit them and slow down.

- __The Water__ -> The player has to avoid getting overtaken by the water at all
 costs otherwise he will drown.
  
- __The table and Stick__ -> This is what the player uses to be able to be on
 top of the water and get to the other side of the ship.
  
## __Types of Obstacles__

- __Table__ -> To pass this obstacle the player has to crawl under or jump over.

- __Room-cleaning cart__ -> To pass this object the player has to jump over the
 cart.

- __Broken Lamp__ -> To pass this obstacle the player has to crawl under this
 lamp

## __Means of Storytelling__

In this game we will use cutscenes for when the player isn't controlling our
 main character. For example, when Arthur is going up floors, at the beginning
 and at the end of the game or when Arthur gets hit by a door.

## __Art__

### __Cutscene__

For the initial cutscene we will have Arthur leave the room then the water
 rushes in through the hallway and he starts running.

### __Hallway__

This is the hallway that we are going to put on loop for the first part of the
 game. Has the player goes through the lights behind him turn off due to a
power failure.
